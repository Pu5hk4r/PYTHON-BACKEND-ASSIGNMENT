# Python Assignment Project

## Overview
This project consists of four main tasks:
1. **Backend Development**: A Flask API to manage various functionalities for interacting with the Android emulator.
2. **Database Management**: PostgreSQL integration to store system information, app data, and logs.
3. **Virtual Android System Simulation**: Simulation of an Android environment where APKs can be installed, and system information is logged.
4. **Basic Networking**: Data exchange between the Android emulator and the backend, enabling seamless communication for various operations.

## Project Working
This project aims to simulate an Android environment while interacting with a backend server. Here's how each component works:

### 1. **Backend Development (Flask API)**:

   - A Flask API serves as the central hub for managing requests related to the Android system simulation.
   - It handles requests for installing APKs, fetching system logs, and managing system information.
   - The API exposes endpoints to interact with the Android emulator, including installing apps, retrieving system data (such as device info), and sending commands to the emulator.

### 2. **Database Management (PostgreSQL Integration)**:

  - The backend interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and manage system data and logs generated by the Android emulator.
   - The database schema includes tables for logging APK installations, system states, error logs, and data sent/received during networking operations.
   - Data is stored and queried efficiently to keep track of the emulatorâ€™s status and any changes in system configurations.

### 3. **Virtual Android System Simulation**:

![emulator](https://github.com/Pu5hk4r/PYTHON-BACKEND-ASSIGNMENT/blob/main/Assets/amd_android_emulator.png)
   - Using Android Studio and the Android SDK, the project simulates a virtual Android environment via an emulator.
   - APK files are installed onto the emulator, and logs about system activity, including app performance and system status, are captured.
   - The backend communicates with the emulator via the `ppadb` Python package, which allows control over the virtual Android device (e.g., installing APKs, retrieving system logs, etc.).

### 4. **Basic Networking (Data Exchange Between Emulator and Backend)**:

  ![logs](https://github.com/Pu5hk4r/PYTHON-BACKEND-ASSIGNMENT/blob/main/Assets/logcat-split-view.png)
   - Data is exchanged between the Android emulator and the Flask backend using HTTP requests and responses.
   - The backend sends commands to the emulator to install APKs and retrieve logs, and the emulator sends back responses (such as success or failure) to be stored in the database.
   - The network layer ensures smooth communication between the backend and the Android emulator, enabling real-time interactions like log retrieval, status updates, and app management.

## Prerequisites
To set up and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12.5
- PostgreSQL
- Android Studio / Android SDK
- Required Python packages (listed in `backend/requirements.txt`), including:
  - `ppadb`
  - `requests`

## Setup
Follow the instructions below to set up the environment for the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Pu5hk4r/PYTHON-BACKEND-ASSIGNMENT.git
    ```

2. **Set up the PostgreSQL database**:
    - Install PostgreSQL and create a new database.
    - Use the provided SQL scripts or migrations to set up tables and schemas.

3. **Install dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Task-specific setup**:
    - Refer to the individual task README files for any additional setup or configuration instructions for each task.

## Running the Project
- **Backend Development**: Follow the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file to start the Flask API.
- **Database Management**: Refer to the `database/README.md` for setting up and testing PostgreSQL integration.
- **Virtual Android System Simulation**: Follow the `android_simulation/README.md` to run the Android emulator and install APKs.
- **Basic Networking**: Check the `networking/README.md` for setting up communication between the emulator and the backend.
